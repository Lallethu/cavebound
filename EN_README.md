# Havin fun with Love 2D and web development

## Objectives

- learn how to properly use Love 2D and create a simple game
- learn to keep a project organized and well-documented
- get feedback on my work
- improve my programming skills
- document the process and share it with others
- have fun!

## Road map

1. Maybe try to create a specification for the whole project, and a GDG (Game Design Document) for the game.
2. Create a simple prototype of the game using Love 2D.
3. Develop a plan for the game, including a list of features and a timeline for development.
4. Build out the game, adding new features and refining the mechanics.
5. Playtest the game regularly to catch any bugs or issues.
6. Polish the game and add any final touches.
7. Release the game to the world!

## Reminder

When working on a project, it's important to stay organized and keep track of progress. Here are some tips to help me stay on track:

- Start small: It's easy to get carried away with grand ideas, but starting with a smaller, simpler game will help you gain experience and develop skills.
- Stay organized: Keep the code and assets organized and well-documented to make it easier to work on the game as it grows.
- Be flexible: Don't be afraid to make changes to the plan or adjust the game mechanics if something isn't working as well as I'd like.
- Get feedback: Share the game with others and get feedback on what they like and what could be improved. This will help me make the game as good as it can be.
- Have fun: Remember that the goal of the project is to have fun and learn new things. Don't get too caught up in making everything perfect and enjoy the process!

## Tech used

I aim to get better at using the following technologies:

- Lua
- Love 2D (Lua framework)
- React (JavaScript library) - for front-end development
- Node.js (JavaScript runtime) - for back-end development
- Docker
- MongoDB (NoSQL database)
- Whatever else I find interesting
